## 🧠 How the Model Works

This project uses a Teachable Machine model trained to classify:
  😷 Mask On
  🙅‍♂️ No Mask
  😐 Improper Mask

You can easily replace the model link with your own by exporting from Teachable Machine and updating the following line in `index.html`:

```js
const URL = "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/qfwIBmrBx/";
